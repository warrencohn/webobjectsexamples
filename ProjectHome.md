## Overview ##

This project is currently used as an incubator sandbox for the fixing and conversion of Apple's WebObjects examples so that a new user can readily and easily get started with the examples. The current shipped examples do not run "out of the box".

## Objectives ##
  1. Examples run out of the box with both WO 5.3.3 and WO 5.4.3. Exceptions to this should be noted.
  1. Examples use Wonder to achieve WO version compatability and reliability
  1. One step setup of Wonder install and databases setup using java derby database engine
  1. Build Project WOnder awareness for newcomers to WebObjects and encourage new users to explore Project WOnder source rather than just work with binaries
  1. Standard project layout throughout - same as the standard layout for new WOLips projects

## Quick Start ##
Make sure you have Eclipse 3.4 and latest WOLips nightly. If your current production setup does not allow for that, simply use **another** copy of Eclipse 3.4 (You know you can have multiple copies of Eclipse and run them all at the same time, don't you? ;-)  )

These projects are linked against a **recent** Project Wonder.... the "repackaged" Wonder which happened around May 2008. So make sure you have a recent one. If you like convenience, check out the WonderTeamUtilities project and run the install script provided there. See that utility project's README for more info.
